# Documentation on Tools

## Introduction

This directory contain detailed documentation on various tools that
can be used to manipulate the source files available in the Project CodeNet
dataset.

It also contains working documents on proposals and ideas for tools,
formats, and applications.

## HSQLDB

HSQLDB is a simple but complete database software that can use CSV files as
persistent storage. This [document](./HSQLDB.md) describes how to convert the
Project CodeNet metadata to be used with HSQLDB.

## srcml

srcML is a tool for the analysis of programming language source code.
The [document](./srcml.md) describes typical use cases.

## Syntax-correct Tokenstream

It is possible to obtain a token (class) stream from a source code file such
that the result is still syntactically correct. This
[document](./syntax-correct-tokenstream.md) shows how.

## Universal Tokens

Some thoughts and a proposal to normalize the token classes for various
programming languages are presented [here](./universal_tokens.md).
